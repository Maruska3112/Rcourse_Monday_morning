## Introduction

This aim of this report is to visualize the proportion of positive and negative COVID-19 tests by gender and calculate whether there was a significant difference between the proportion of positive and negative COVID-19 between the genders. The covid_testing dataset from the medicaldata package in R will be used for this analysis. 


## Data 

The data from the medicaldata package in R were used. Information about the dataset can be accessed here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/medicaldata/medicaldata.pdf>


```{r}
#| output: false

# Read data and assigning them to an object
# Data comes from the medicaldata package in R

data_covid <- covid_testing
```

```{r}
# Process data
sorted_covid <- data_covid %>%
  arrange(pan_day)

# Summary table with counts of positive and negative cases for each gender
summary_table <- sorted_covid %>%
  group_by(gender, result) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Calculating proportions
summary_table <- summary_table %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count))


```


```{r}
# Data Analysis
# Differences in the number of positive and negative COVID-19 test results between genders.
# Applying chi-squared test

cont_table <- table(sorted_covid$gender, sorted_covid$result)

# Perform chi-square test of independence
chi_sq_test <- chisq.test(cont_table)
```

### Numbers of positive, negative and invalid Covid-19 test results per Gender

```{r}
# Print contingency table
print(cont_table)
```

### Chi-squared test results

```{r}
# Print chi-square test result
print(chi_sq_test)
```

## Analysis Conclusion

The results of the chi-squared test showed that there is no significant difference in the COVID-19 test results between the genders. 

@fig_covid_cases shows the proportion of positive and negative COVID-19 tests per gender.  

### Figure 1: Proportions of Positive and Negative Covid-19 Tests by Gender


```{r fig_covid_cases, echo = FALSE}

# Figure: Covid-19 Test results by gender. 

#| label: fig_covid_cases
#| fig-cap: "Proportions of Positive and Negative Covid-19 Tests by Gender."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

# Create bar plot showing the proportions
fig_covid_cases <- ggplot(summary_table, aes(x = gender, y = proportion, fill = result)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) + # Add text labels for exact counts
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("negative" = "blue", "positive" = "red")) +  # Set colors for negative and positive results
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Proportion", title = "Proportions of Positive and Negative Covid-19 Tests by Gender") +
  theme_minimal()

print(fig_covid_cases)

```

## Conclusion

The aim of this report was to visualise the proportion of positive and negative COVID-19 tests by gender. By visual inspection, we can see that the proportion of positive and negative tests does not seem to differ meaningfully between genders. Applying the chi-squared test, there was no significant difference between the numbers of positive and negavtive COVID-19 tests by gender.
