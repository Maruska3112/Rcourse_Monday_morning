## Introduction

This report will visualize the proportion of positive and negative COVID-19 tests in relationship to the amount of days after the start of the pandemic. The covid_testing dataset from the medicaldata package in R will be used. 


## Data 

The data from the medicaldata package in R were used. Information about the dataset can be accessed here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/medicaldata/medicaldata.pdf>


```{r}
#| output: false

# Read data and assigning them to an object
# Data comes from the medicaldata package in R

data_covid <- covid_testing
```

```{r}
# Process data

sorted_covid <- data_covid %>%
  arrange(pan_day)


```

Figure x shows the number of positive COVID-19 cases according to the day after the start of the pandemic. 

```{r}

#| label: fig_covid_cases
#| fig-cap: "Positive COVID-19 results in time"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

# Calculate the proportions of positive and negative tests by gender
proportions <- sorted_covid %>%
  group_by(gender, result) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count))

# Create a bar plot showing the proportions
ggplot(proportions, aes(x = gender, y = proportion, fill = result)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("negative" = "blue", "positive" = "red")) +  # Set colors for negative and positive results
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Proportion", title = "Proportions of Positive and Negative Tests by Gender") +
  theme_minimal()




```

## Conclusion

In the figure, we can see the proportion of the positive and negative covid tests by gender. 

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
